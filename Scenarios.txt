A user requests a taxi:
- A user access the app (mobile or web?)
- The user request a taxi
- The system receive the request
- The system, by interaction with the mapping serve, compute in which zone the user is
- The system checks if in this zone there is a taxi available; let's suppose there is one (or do we have to consider also the other case?)
- The system sends to the taxi driver a notification (with which info???)
- The taxi driver accepts

A taxi driver has ended a ride and wants to communicate his availability:
- The taxi driver sends a notification of "ride endend"
- The system receive it and delete the request of the user (?)
