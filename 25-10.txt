Stakeholders:
- taxi drivers
- taxi driversâ€™ union
- users
- association of consumer rights

- mobile phone producer/reseller? 
- training and user support staff? does it even exists?


Terminology and acronym (momentary):
- "system"
- "taxi driver", "user", ... (???)
- "code" or "taxi code"
- "taxi" (???)
- "available taxi"
- "unavailable taxi"
- "zone"
- "unavailability list", UL: the list where codes of the taxi drivers actually unavailable are stored;
- "zone queue", ZQ: the FIFO list, one for each zone, where the codes of taxi drivers available for a ride in that zone are stored;
- "pending call zone queue", PQ: the FIFO list, one for each zone, where calls of users that are requesting a ride in that zone are stored until a taxi in that zone is available;
- "out of city list", OCL: the list where the code of taxi drivers actually out of city are put in;
- "reservations register", RR: the data structure that stores all the reservation of users; 


GOALS / REQ. :

Taxi drivers:








	
Users:

 

[TODO how can we formulate the corresponding assumption?]

-




System:


- there is no ZQ or PQ that is not associated to a taxi zone;
- the system periodically sends messages to users to whom the code of an incoming taxi has been already communicated
	-- this requires a list of "request in progress / managing"
