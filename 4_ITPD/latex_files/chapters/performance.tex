\chapter{Performance analysis}
While a full fledged performance analysis of the entire myTaxiService infrastructure will be executed only in the system integration phase, it is still useful to perform some preliminary measures on components whose performances can be tested in isolation.

In particular, it is appropriate to verify that the applications for all the target mobile platforms, regardless whether they're destined to taxi drivers or to passengers, have reasonable CPU and main memory usages. 

As specified in the RASD, the performance requirements of the mobile applications are the followings:
\begin{itemize}
	\item They must run correctly on smartphones with single core processors clocked at 800Mhz or more.
	\item They must use no more than 64 MB of RAM to execute.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, even though no strict value is fixed at this point, the storage occupation should be reasonably small. Given the current trends in the size of the image assets needed to support high resolution devices, it is reasonable to expect a 30MB size cap; however, this number should be reconsidered during the development phase taking into account the improvements in the smartphone and tablet technology that may occur meanwhile.

These tests will be performed using the appropriate performance analysis tool provided with the SDK of each mobile platform.
