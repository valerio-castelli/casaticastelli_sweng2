\chapter{Code issues}
This chapter highlights all the bad practices that we have recognized during the inspection of \code{ActiveJmsResourceAdapter}, and specifically in methods \code{createManagedConnectionFactory} and \code{createManagedConnectionFactories}. The issues we have identified can be either traced back to specific violations of the checklist, or to other bad programming practices. 

\section{Notation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single lines of code are denoted as \codeline{123}.
    \item Intervals of lines of code are denoted as \codelines{123}{456}.
    \item Specific points in the code inspection checklist are denoted as \checklist{1}, \checklist{2}, ...

\section{Checklist issues}

\subsection{ActiveJmsResourceAdapter class}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \checklist{1} Constant \code{ADDRESSLIST} at \codeline{239} and variable \code{addressList} at \codeline{255} rely only on Java's case sensitivity to be distinguished one from the other. 
	\item \checklist{1} Variable \code{addressList} at \codeline{255} and variable \code{urlList} at \codeline{253} refer to similar concepts and should probably be more clearly described. 
	\item \checklist{1} Variable \code{nm} at \codeline{306} and variable \code{sm} at \codeline{250} don't really suggest that they represent instances of \code{GlassfishNamingManager} and \code{StringManager}, respectively.
	\item \checklist{1} The name of variable \code{brkrPort} at \codeline{257} is unnecessarily short (variable \code{brokerInstanceName} at \codeline{297} uses the full word “broker”). 
	\item \checklist{1} The name of method \code{handles(ConnectorDescriptor cd, String moduleName)} at \codeline{1161} doesn't clearly described what this method is supposed to, nor why it is returning a boolean. 
	\item \checklist{5} The name of method \code{listToProperties} at \codeline{1101} is not a verb. The same is valid for method \code{postConstruct} at \codeline{342} and for method \code{postRAConfiguration} at \codeline{860}.
	\item \checklist{7} There is a huge number of constants which do not follow the naming convention at \codelines{166}{202}, \codelines{207}{211}, \codeline{213}, \codelines{233}{237}, \codeline{242}, \codeline{246}, \codelines{262}{264}. 
	\item \checklist{8} and \checklist{9} are not followed consistently throughout the code. Most of the class uses four spaces indentation, but tabs are also occasionally used as at \codeline{357}, \codeline{493}, \codelines{537}{556}, \codelines{992}{997}, \codelines{1008-1010}, \codelines{1026}{1030}, \codelines{1102}{1112}, \codelines{1351}{1357}, \codelines{1976}{1978}. 
	\item \checklist{11} There are a number of single-line \code{if} statements that do not follow the convention. It would be very time consuming to enumerate them all, but at \codeline{1245}, \codeline{1254}, \codeline{1303}, \codeline{1307} there are a few examples of this behavior. 
\end{enumerate}
