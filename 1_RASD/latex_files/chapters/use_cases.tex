\hline
Exceptions &
- If the passenger mobile app cannot receive the GPS location, the mobile app asks the passenger to insert his position manually.

- If the passenger cannot connect to Internet, the mobile app tells the passenger that he can't call a taxi at the moment.

- If the taxi driver refuses the call (or doesn't answer in 2 minutes), the system moves the taxi driver in the last position of the zone queue and forwards the request to the next available taxi driver.

- If the system cannot forward the request to the taxi driver because he is not connected to Internet, it moves the taxi driver in the last position of the zone queue and forwards the request to the next available taxi driver.

- If all taxi drivers refuse the request, the system notifies the passenger that is request could not be fulfilled.

- If the passenger doesn't show up at the meeting location, the taxi driver clicks on the ``drop call'' button. The system will then notify the user that his request has been dropped. \\
