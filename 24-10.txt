- When a taxi driver marks himself as available, the mobile application should send his GPS coordinates to the central system.
- When a taxi driver marks himself as available, the system should use the retrieved GPS coordinates to compute the taxi zone to which the taxi belongs and move its code into the last position of the corresponding queue. 
- If the system successfully registers a taxi driver as available, it should send him a positive notification on the mobile application. Otherwise, it should send him a negative notification and ask him to retry later.
- When a taxi driver marks himself as unavailable, his taxi code should be moved into the unavailability list.
- When a taxi driver is moved to the unavailability list, he should receive a notification warning him that he’s no longer available to accept requests.


Goal 5: The allocation and distribution of taxis should be managed fairly and consistently.
Requirements:
- The system should consider all drivers to be initially (?) unavailable by default.
- The unavailability status of a taxi driver should not be affected by him leaving or entering the city.
- Each taxi zone must be internally associated with a queue containing the codes of the available taxis.

- The system must implement a list where to store codes of taxis who are currently out of the city (“out-of-city list”).
- If a taxi driver who has marked himself as available changes zone while he’s not on a ride, the system should move his code in the queue of the new zone. 
- If a taxi driver who is currently on a ride changes zone, the system should keep his code into the “currently riding list”. 
- If a taxi driver who has marked himself as available exits the city while he’s not on a ride, the system should put it into an “out-of-city” list.
- If a taxi driver who is currently on a ride exits the city, the system should keep his code into the “currently riding list”.
- If a taxi driver whose taxi code is in the “out-of-city” list enters the city and the taxi driver was available before leaving the city and he has not marked himself as unavailable, the system should assign it to the queue of the zone in which he has entered.
- If a taxi driver whose taxi code is in the “out-of-city” list enters the city and the taxi driver has signaled himself as unavailable while he was out, the system should move the driver to the unavailability list.
- If a taxi driver leaves the city while he’s unavailable, the system should prevent him from signaling he’s available until he is again in the perimeter of the city.
- The mobile application of each taxi driver should periodically send his GPS coordinates to the main system. 

Goal 6: The taxi driver should be able to receive, accept and refuse ride requests.
Requirements:

- If a taxi driver uses the “drop request” functionality, the system should notify the passenger that his request has been dropped. 

Goal 8: The taxi driver should be able to communicate he has terminated a ride.
Requirements:
- A taxi driver who has terminated a ride should be able to notify the system that the ride has ended.
- A taxi driver should be able to notify that he’s terminated a ride only after the system has checked that the meeting point has actually been reached within a given level of precision. (?) 
- When the system receives the notification that a driver has terminated a ride and the driver is still outside the city, the system should move him to the “out-of-city” list.
- When the system receives the notification that a driver has terminated a ride and the driver is inside the city, the system should assign him to the queue of the zone in which he is.

- If it’s not possible to establish an internet connection to the central system, the mobile application should notify the user that it’s unable to operate correctly.
- In case the internet connection goes down at any point during the request process, the mobile application should abort the process and notify the user that the request could not be completed.
- When a user requests a ride, the system should use the source field of the request to compute the corresponding taxi zone. 
- After a request’s taxi zone has been computed, the system should assign the request to the first taxi in that zone’s queue.
- If a taxi driver accepts a request for a ride, the system should send a notification to the requesting user containing the code of the incoming taxi and an estimation of the waiting time (ETA).
- If the selected taxi driver refuses the request, the system should move his taxi code to the last position of the queue and forward the request to the following taxi in the queue.
