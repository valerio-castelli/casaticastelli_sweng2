- Contact information of taxi drivers are not disclosed by the city administration.
- All the data already stored in the system-as-is is actually transferred to the system-to-be when it is put into operation. [related req.: how can we transfer this data?]

( - qualunque meccanismo di prenotazione fosse in atto prima (ad es. telefonica), non verrà più usato )
- Users don't have the need to choose a particular taxi driver among those that are available for their ride.
- Users do not have to confirm the choice of the selected taxi.
- Users are not allowed to place reservations more than 15 days in advance. 

- The city council has divided the city in taxi zones.
- The city council may update the taxi zone division in the future. (is this a req.? probably yes)

- The taxi service is operated 24h/day, unless exceptional circumstances occur. ***
- In case any exceptional circumstance occur for which the taxi service cannot be operated, the system is not required to satisfy incoming and reserved requests. 

*** exceptional circumstance: strikes, severe weather conditions, service suspension decided by the city council, particular holidays… [terminology]

- Traffic information and route data can be obtained from a third party mapping service.

- Every taxi driver is provided with a business mobile phone by the city council.

- Every taxi is uniquely identified by an alphanumeric code that is assigned by the city administration when he becomes part of the taxi service 
	-- we have to define what we mean by taxi service in the acronym and def. section


- The only taxis eligible for fulfilling a reservation are the ones that are present in the queue of the zone associated with the reservation source address 10 minutes before the scheduled meeting time.


- In order to receive ride requests, a taxi driver must explicitly mark himself as available.
- A taxi driver will not be able to receive ride requests while he’s unavailable.
- Taxis that are considered to be out-of-city will not be able to receive calls. (redundant?)

- A taxi driver must always notify the system when he terminates a ride. 

- A user that has already requested a taxi will not request another one before having completed his ride.

- A user must be registered and logged in to the system in order to reserve a ride.

- After a taxi driver has been associated to a call, he must confirm or refuse the request within two minutes. After that period of time, the call is considered refused.
