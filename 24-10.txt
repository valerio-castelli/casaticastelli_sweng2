Assumptions:
- User can only request rides using either the web application or the mobile application provided by the system.
- [OR] Users do not request rides using their personal acquaintance with taxi drivers.
- Taxi drivers will only make rides by accepting a request from the system.
- Contact information of taxi drivers are not disclosed by the city administration.
- All the data already stored in the system-as-is is actually transferred to the system-to-be when it is put into operation. [related req.: how can we transfer this data?]

( - qualunque meccanismo di prenotazione fosse in atto prima (ad es. telefonica), non verrà più usato )
- Users don't have the need to choose a particular taxi driver among those that are available for their ride.
- Users do not have to confirm the choice of the selected taxi.

- The city council has divided the city in taxi zones.
- The city council may update the taxi zone division in the future. (is this a req.? probably yes)

- The taxi service is operated 24h/day, unless exceptional circumstances occur. ***
- In case any exceptional circumstance occur for which the taxi service cannot be operated, the system is not required to satisfy incoming and reserved requests. 

*** exceptional circumstance: strikes, severe weather conditions, service suspension decided by the city council, particular holidays… [terminology]


- Every taxi driver is provided with a business mobile phone by the city council.

- Every taxi is uniquely identified by an alphanumeric code that is assigned by the city administration when he becomes part of the taxi service 
	-- we have to define what we mean by taxi service in the acronym and def. section
"User will request a ride only from within the city." (i.e., the origin of the ride is inside the city)
	-- Not an assumption: TBD as a requirement (“the system should not allow for requests to have an origin outside the city”)



Goal 1: "L'amministrazione deve avere la possibilità di trasferire i dati dei tassisti nel nuovo sistema"
Requirements:
- "The system must provide a data entry form to collect data about the taxi drivers"
	- Data: name, surname, mobile phone number, code/identifier, taxi driver license, taxi license plate
- "The system must provide a way for the operator to confirm that the initial data entry operation is complete (i.e., a button)"
- The system will not allow any operation to take place until data entry is completed"
