In this section we'll specifically cover in detail how the requirements identified in the SRS document are satisfied by our myTaxiService architecture. 

\section{Functional Requirements}

For sake of readability, we will use the notation \textbf{req. x.y} to make reference to the y-th requirement associated with the x-th goal.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Goal 1, 2 and 3} are essentially administration-oriented requirements; as such, they are satisfied by:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{System Administration} component, which provides the backend business logic to handle the required data modification operations. In particular, operations related to taxi and taxi drivers (goal 1, 2) are handled by the Taxi Driver Management sub-component, while operations related to the definition of taxi zones (goal 1, 3) are handled by the Zone Division Management sub-component.
	\item The \textbf{Administration Web Application} component, which provides administrators an appropriate user interface to interact with the backend.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Goal 4} describes the way in which the availability status of a taxi driver is updated. As such, several components are involved in its fulfillment:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Driver Application} component, which provides taxi drivers the ability to interact with the central system to notify a change in their availability status. In particular, this component is responsible for reqs. 4.1 to 4.6 and reqs. 4.8, 4.11.
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Management System} component, which provides the backend business logic to handle the update operations. In particular:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Req. 4.6 and 4.7 is handled by the Location Management sub-component for the zone computation part and by the Taxi Management sub-component for the update operation on taxi queues
	\item Reqs 4.9 and 4.10 are handled by the Taxi Management sub-component by moving the taxi to the unavailability list and setting its status to "unavailable"
	\item Req. 4.8 and 4.11 are handled by the Taxi Management sub-component
	\end{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Notification System} component, which provides to the central system the dispatch mechanism it needs for sending notifications to the taxi driver application. This component is essentially involved in satisfying reqs. 4.6, 4.8 and 4.11.
	\end{itemize}\end{itemize}
