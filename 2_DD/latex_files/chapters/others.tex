In this section we'll specifically cover in detail how the requirements identified in the SRS document are satisfied by our myTaxiService architecture. 

\section{Functional Requirements}

For sake of readability, we will use the notation \textbf{req. x.y} to make reference to the y-th requirement associated with the x-th goal.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Goal 1, 2 and 3} are essentially administration-oriented requirements; as such, they are satisfied by:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{System Administration} component, which provides the backend business logic to handle the required data modification operations. In particular, operations related to taxi and taxi drivers (goal 1, 2) are handled by the Taxi Driver Management sub-component, while operations related to the definition of taxi zones (goal 1, 3) are handled by the Zone Division Management sub-component.
	\item The \textbf{Administration Web Application} component, which provides administrators an appropriate user interface to interact with the backend.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Goal 4} describes the way in which the availability status of a taxi driver is updated. As such, several components are involved in its fulfillment:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Driver Application} component, which provides taxi drivers the ability to interact with the central system to notify a change in their availability status. In particular, this component is responsible for reqs. 4.1 to 4.6 and reqs. 4.8, 4.11.
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Management System} component, which provides the backend business logic to handle the update operations. In particular:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Req. 4.6 and 4.7 is handled by the Location Management sub-component for the zone computation part and by the Taxi Management sub-component for the update operation on taxi queues
	\item Reqs 4.9 and 4.10 are handled by the Taxi Management sub-component by moving the taxi to the unavailability list and setting its status to "unavailable"
	\item Req. 4.8 and 4.11 are handled by the Taxi Management sub-component
	\end{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Notification System} component, which provides to the central system the dispatch mechanism it needs for sending notifications to the taxi driver application. This component is essentially involved in satisfying reqs. 4.6, 4.8 and 4.11.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Goal 5} requires the allocation and distribution of taxis to be managed fairly and consistently. This is achieved by an interplay of components: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Management System} is the key component that concurs to the fulfillment of the goal. More specifically, reqs. 5.1 to 5.10 are handled by the Taxi Management sub-component, with the aid of the Location Management sub-component as for those requirements that involve checking whether the taxi driver is still inside the city or not. 
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Driver Application} component is crucial in fulfilling reqs 5.11 and 5.12 by providing an appropriate management of the UI to prevent incorrect availability assignments and by sending the GPS coordinates of the taxi driver to the central system with a given frequency.
	\item The \textbf{Remote Services Interface} component, which enables the taxi driver application to request services to the central system and thus provides the necessary callbacks to satisfy req. 5.12. 	
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Goal 6} is related to the ability of a taxi driver to receive, accept and refuse ride requests. This involves:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Management System} component, which is responsible of fulfilling reqs. 6.1, 6.2, and 6.4 to 6.6 by means of the Taxi Management sub-component.
	\item The \textbf{Mapping Service} component, which provides the reverse-geocoding capability to fulfill req. 6.2 and the map data to fulfill req. 6.8.
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Driver Application} component, which is responsible of fulfilling reqs. 6.1, 6.3, 6.7 and 6.8 by providing to the taxi driver an appropriate UI.
	\item The \textbf{Notification System} component, which provides to the central system the dispatch mechanism it needs for sending notifications to the taxi driver application and fulfill req 6.1.
	\item The \textbf{Remote Services Interface} component, which enables the taxi driver application to request services to the central system and thus provides the necessary callbacks to satisfy reqs. 6.4 and 6.5.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Goal 7} gives a taxi driver the ability to drop a request if the passenger doesn't show up. In order for this functionality to work correctly, several components should cooperate:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Driver Application} component, which provides a suitable UI to drop the request (req. 7.1) and retrieves the current GPS location fo the taxi driver in order to let the central system check if it matches the agreed meeting point (req. 7.2).
	\item The \textbf{Taxi Management System} component, which is responsible of satisfying all the three requirements related to this goal, in particular my means of the Taxi Management and Request Management sub-components.
	\item The \textbf{Passenger Application} component, which is responsible of implementing a suitable UI view to notify a user that his request has been dropped (req. 7.3).
	\item The \textbf{Notification System} component, which provides to the central system the dispatch mechanism it needs for sending notifications to both the taxi driver application and the passenger application and fulfill req 7.3.
	\item The \textbf{Remote Services Interface} component, which enables the taxi driver application to request services to the central system and thus provides the necessary callbacks to satisfy reqs. 7.1 and 7.2.
	\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
