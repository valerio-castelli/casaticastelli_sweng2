\section{Purpose and scope}
This document represents the Project Plan Document for myTaxiService.

Its main purpose is to analyze the expected complexity of myTaxiService and assist the project leader in the delicate phase of cost and effort estimation. This information can be subsequently used as a guidance to define the required budget, the resources allocation and the schedule of the activities. 

In the first section, we're going to use the Function Points and COCOMO approaches together to provide an estimate of the expected size of myTaxiService in terms of lines of code and of the cost/effort required to actually develop it.

In the second section, we'll reuse these figures to propose a possible schedule for the project that covers all activities from the requirements identification to the implementation and testing activities. 

In the third section we're going to assign the different members of our development group to the various tasks.

Finally, we're going to elaborate on the possible risks that myTaxiService could face during the various phase of the project and provide some general conclusions.
