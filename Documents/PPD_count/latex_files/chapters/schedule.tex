\chapter{Schedule}
In this chapter we're going to provide a general, high-level project schedule. More refined schedules will be defined during the project to manage the internal organization of the single development phases.

It is important to notice that, while this project is made for didactic purposes and no implementation and testing will be performed, we have nevertheless considered these steps as part of our schedule. This is to try to take into account what could be the full development of this project, should it continue. 

In order to maintain readability, we have split the schedule in two halves, the first one covering the period from September to January and the second going from February to June.

Furthermore, given the size of the document, it is included in separate pages.
