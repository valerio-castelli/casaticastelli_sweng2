\chapter{Resource allocation}
In this chapter we're going to provide a general overview of how the tasks defined by the schedule in the previous section will be divided between the two members of the development team. More refined schedules will be defined during the project to manage the internal organization of the single development phases.

As we already mentioned in the previous section, we have also included activities in the requirement analysis and design phases that won't actually take place, like the stakeholders meetings, as well as the full implementation phase. This has been purposefully done to have a more realistic depiction of how the development process could go.

In order to maintain readability, we have split the document in four parts. There are two parts for each team member, each one furthermore divided in two halves: the first one covering the period from September to January and the second going from February to June.

Furthermore, given the size of the document, it is included in separate pages.
